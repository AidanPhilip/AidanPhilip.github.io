        Hi, I'm Aidan Languedoc. <br> I'm currently a computer science student at URI, planning to graduate around 2025/2026.

            I transfered from WPI in Fall of 2021, and I've been trying to make up lost ground since. <br>
            I've been an editor for the YouTube channel <em> Too Many Zooz </em> for about 7 months, and have been editing for 4 years. <br> <br>
            <img id="img2" src="IMG_0172.png" alt="a picture of me with some more dudes">
            So I really don't know where things are going for me next, but we'll find out.
